# AKWF-FREE-Elektron-Model-Samples

This repo contains _only_ the Elektron
[Model:Samples](https://www.elektron.se/en/modelsamples-explorer)
directories from Kristoffer Ekstrand's generous collection of free wave form
audio files. The full collection can be found here:

https://github.com/KristofferKarlAxelEkstrand/AKWF-FREE

This repo is not a fork of that repo, because the whole point of this repo is
to only download the Model:Samples directories, and (unless I'm stupid maybe?)
this is hard to do with a fork.

Original README follows. _Thanks Adventure Kid!_

# AKWF

AKWF or Adventure Kid Waveforms is a collection of one cycle waveforms to be used within synthesizers or other kinds of sound generators. It is basically the smallest sound possible to sample and still get the overall feel of the sampled instrument.
